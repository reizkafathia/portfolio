# Personal Portfolio Website

This was the very first website I built back in **July 2023** as a final project for the **Super Member program at GDSC Universitas Indonesia**. It was the starting point of my journey into web development, where I began learning how to use technologies such as **JavaScript**, **HTML**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, and modern front-end tools. The result is far from perfect and still looks simple and unpolished, but it represents an important first step that I am proud of.
